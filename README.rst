Using BlobGivingBot
-------------------

BlobGivingBot is meant for use in the `Blob Emoji Discord Server <https://discord.gg/xTf9URq>`_,
there's no public bot instance you can simply invite.

It is however really simple to run your own instance for your own Discord Servers:

- Simply rename ``config_example.py`` to ``config.py`` and fill it out with your credentials.

- Invoke commands in any specified command channels using your prefix.
